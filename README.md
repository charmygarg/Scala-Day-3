Problem statement

Design a simple ETL process – Extract Transform and Load

First Part

• Read files from a directory

• For each file read contents of the file

• Capitalize the contents of the file

• Then write the capitalized content into another output file with the same name in a

different directory

Second Part:

• Read all the unique words from the file

• For each word calculate the word count

• For eg: for a file containing the content

“Hello world, hello”

In this case the summary would be

hello -> 2

world -> 1

• For simplicity cases should be ignored – Hello and hello mean the same word

• This summary should then be added to an output file with the same name in a

different directory

Design Considerations:

• It should be easy to add or remove transformations

• Input source could change i.e. –

• In future we could read contents from a SQL table

• Output source could also change i.e –

• In future we could write contents to a SQL table

Expectations:

1. You are required to help create the software that works according to the sample

inputs applied and generates output as shown in the Input-Output section shown

for the problem.

2. You should demonstrate the working software by building a console application or

writing test program that exercises the sample inputs, for this purpose you may use

jUnit or any other testing framework.

3. Maturity of your solution will be judged on your object oriented analysis and design

skills. Your coding skills will also be judged.

4. Please note that the problems below do not require any relational database or

knowledge of underlying OS or Windowing platform.
